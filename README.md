# ðŸŽ® Godot Game Prototype â€“ From Low-Level C++ to Commercial-Style Game in Godot

This repository contains a **top-down 2D golf-themed game prototype** developed using the **Godot Engine**, with gameplay mechanics, visual systems, and architecture inspired by a prior low-level C++/SDL2 version.

> âœ… Prototype in C++/SDL2 version: [Golf-Game-Prototype-cpp](https://github.com/DiegoChiodi/Golf-Game-Prototype-cpp)

The goal is not only to understand how Godot works under the hood, but also to build a game approaching **commercial quality**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Create a full 2D game prototype using the Godot Engine.
- Design **modular systems** and **reusable components**.
- Build **gameplay, physics, animation, UI, and audio** from scratch.
- Understand Godot's architecture: **scene tree, nodes, signals, scripting**.
- Explore GDScript, C#, and optionally C++ modules for **hybrid performance**.
- Use C++/SDL2 experience to implement **optimized systems**.
- Push the prototype closer to a **production-ready or commercial structure**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project Stands Out

Unlike beginner Godot projects that rely on plug-and-play features, this prototype is built with a deep **engineering mindset**, thanks to:

- Manual implementation of **rendering, game loop, memory, and physics** in C++.
- Clear grasp of how game engines work internally.
- Focus on **optimization, modularity, and scalability**.

This approach helps avoid treating Godot as a "black box" and instead allows:

- Better debugging and performance profiling.
- Smarter scene design using reusable patterns.
- Efficient and maintainable code architecture.

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools

- **Godot Engine (v4.x)**
- **GDScript** (gameplay logic)
- **C#** (UI tools, typed systems)
- **C++17 / SDL2** (previous prototype core systems)
- **Godot Editor**
- **Git & GitHub** (version control)

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Focus

- Deep understanding of **Godotâ€™s engine architecture**
- Efficient use of **nodes, signals, resources**
- **Scene design patterns** and object composition
- Real-time **2D rendering** and **physics simulation**
- **UI/UX design** and **sound system**
- **Optimization strategies** from C++ experience
- How to bridge a **prototype into a commercial game**

## ðŸ”„ Project Phases

### 1. C++/SDL2 Base Prototype
- Built rendering, physics, logic, and core systems from scratch.

### 2. Rebuilding in Godot
- Applied prior knowledge to structure the game using:
  - GDScript for rapid iteration and core gameplay.
  - C# for typed systems and UI tooling.
  - Optional C++ modules for performance testing.

### 3. Commercialization Phase (ongoing)
- Polishing the prototype with:
  - Animated feedback and visual polish
  - HUD, pause menus, and other UI elements
  - Persistent save/load systems
  - Modular level design with scalable systems

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Outcomes

- Solid foundation in both **low-level (C++)** and **engine-level (Godot)** development.
- Modular, maintainable code ready for future expansion or commercialization.
- Deep understanding of **Godot internals**.
- Confidence working with **GDScript**, **C#**, and **C++**.
